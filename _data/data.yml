    title: About Me
    summary: |
      My research interests range from large-scale graph data analytics (such as disk-based subgraph matching, distributed graph analytics, and graph pattern cardinality estimation) to natural language processing with deep learning. Recently, I am committed to develop techniques for translating natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) and conversational systems for databases.
